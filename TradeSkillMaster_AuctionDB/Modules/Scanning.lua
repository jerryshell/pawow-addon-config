			-- if another addon calls "debugprofilestart()" (which resets that
			-- timer back to zero). It doesn't really matter, since our "seconds
			-- per page" is constantly re-calculated based on the latest "total
			-- amount of whole seconds elapsed", so it doesn't accumulate any
			-- rounding errors and gets more precise the more pages have been
			-- downloaded (after ~10 pages, it's practically as accurate as the
			-- debug-timer). We have to use this technique for safety!
			-- NOTE: Most servers will gradually slow down the page requests
			-- across the first 300 requests or so, which will become slower
			-- and slower, which means that the initial time estimate will
			-- grow until it settles on the correct time remainder. There's
			-- nothing we can do to predict those gradual slowdowns / throttling,
			-- which is why we're also storing the last scan's "final average"
			-- in the database and using that for our subsequent scan estimates.

			-- As we reach 100%, we'll use 100% of the current "real seconds
			-- per page". But at 0%, we'll use the stored value instead.
			-- Between that, we linearly fade the values so that we react
			-- smoothly to changes in speed. This solves the issue that all
			-- servers face, which is their gradual slowdown of page fetches,
			-- where they start out very fast (such as 1.1 seconds per page),
			-- but will have slowed down when you're at the end (such as 2.5 per
			-- page). Typical server slowdown in speed is roughly linear, which
			-- is why our linear blend between "current estimate" and "finished
			-- estimate from previous scan" creates the most accurate results
			-- we're able to get, given the server behavior. It should also
			-- work perfectly on servers which don't follow this pattern, such
			-- as if they have a perfectly linear time between all pages without
			-- any throttling at all, in which case both estimates will basically
			-- agree anyway (both the current and the saved value). This is the
			-- best we can do with the facts of the game. A totally accurate
			-- estimate is impossible, but we're as accurate as we can be.
			-- NOTE: This estimate cannot be improved, since practically all
			-- servers apply random throttling, have various loads and slowdowns
			-- throughout the day, etc. This is the best we can do since the
			-- actual speed depends on the server and is pretty unpredictable.
			-- It would be like trying to predict "the total download-time of a
			-- file that keeps fluctuating between fast and slow speeds". The

	-- IMPORTANT: As explained in the "Scan:AUCTION_ITEM_LIST_UPDATE()" code
	-- comments, we're allowing GetAll scans even when the server DOESN'T return
	-- all auctions. For example, Warmane has chosen to limit GetAll results to
	-- only 55k auctions (even though they usually have 120k+ auctions). This
	-- means that the market data calculations will be missing data. We should
	-- therefore warn the user and tell them to use "Full Scan" instead, when
	-- they're playing on such "limited GetAll" servers. But we'll still allow
	-- use of "GetAll", with a warning message for people who INSIST on using it,
	-- since even when it only looks at half the auctions, it can still give a
	-- "pretty decent" idea of market values.
	-- NOTE: It WOULD be "best" to always throw away (ignore) incomplete "GetAll"
	-- data, but most casual players will prefer to have this feature even if those
	-- incomplete scans are much less accurate than a proper "Full Scan".
	-- NOTE: The inaccuracy of an incomplete "GetAll" scan completely depends on
	-- how the server implements "GetAll". If the server sorts the cheapest
	-- auctions first, then it's somewhat acceptable for popular items which
	-- have many stacks (and are therefore likely to contain enough data points
	-- in the "GetAll" result), and those items will "just" tend to be undervalued
	-- by 2-10% less than their real market value (since their percentile-based
	-- scans will look at less auctions than the real amount). But for very rare
	-- or unpopular items, the partial "GetAll" scan is very dangerous, since
	-- you might only receive the massively overpriced auctions of a certain
	-- item, and thereby calculate an insanely high market value for it. These
	-- dangers are increased if the server sends the auctions in a totally
	-- random order, which means an even greater risk of market price pollution
	-- by only seeing overpriced auctions for many of the items.
	-- NOTE: Furthermore, receiving incomplete "GetAll" results means that TSM
	-- will wipe all of its "cheapest, current buyout price" data for all items,
	-- and then fills them with incorrect data (or nothing at all if an item
	-- wasn't seen in the latest fetch), thus hindering your ability to look up
	-- the correct "best current buyout prices" too.
	-- NOTE: In summary, you'll have to use partial "GetAll" results at your
	-- own risk! A "Full Scan" is ALWAYS much better when your server's "GetAll"
	-- doesn't provide all auction data!
